Gottfried Leibniz was a German polymath, primarily known for the invention of the binary and hexadecimal system. In the course of these inventions, he communicated with various figures including Claudio Filippo Grimaldi; a Jesuit missionary based in China.

Consequently, he designed a text based cipher, which could be used to encrypt the contents of letters. It was designed as below (reproduced from Strickland et al. 2022): -
